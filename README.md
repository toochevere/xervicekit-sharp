# Xervicekit

Xervicekit is a framework intended to provide a backbone for implementation of microservices. It tries to provide certain common functionality, allowing a developer to concentrate on the logic of the service itself without having to worry about the mechanics.  Service calls are abstracted to method calls, so that the logic does not need to concern itself with how data is moved or where the code is actually executing.

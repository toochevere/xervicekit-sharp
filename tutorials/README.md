# Welcome

Welcome to the XerviceKit tutorials.  

## Instructions

These tutorials are to help you understand how to use XerviceKit.  Use the table of contents below to visit the tutorial of your choice.  The README in each folder explains the tutorial and takes you through it. 

Each tutorial starts with a base of code, usually from where the last tutorial left off.  The tutorial will focus on helping you understand a particular point.  They will guide you through making some changes and explain what is happening. Finally, most tutorials will give you ask you to make a further modification to the code based on what you learned.  

The tutorials are designed to be bite-sized chunks but also to allow you struggle a bit.  The intention is to provide ground for discovery.  In any case, the "finished" code is also provided so if you get stuck, you can take a look at it. 

## Contents

These are the tutorials currently available.  More are added as time goes on. 

[Tutorial 1:  Create a basic service](./Tutorial001_Create_A_Basic_Service/)
